Final Project, Phase 1

Instructions for running the main.py program which will perform some basic
statistical analysis of the input data: Wisconsin Breast Cancer.
The program will prompt the user to provide the name of the CSV file which
contains the data; a default value for the file name is also provided.

The program will generate histograms of each data attribute and save them in a
PNG file named after the attribute number (i.e., A2.png, A3.png and so on). 
The statistical analysis table is output to the console.

Usage:

  ./main.py
